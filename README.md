Solar panels are devices designed to convert sunlight into electrical energy
through the photovoltaic effect. This process involves the generation of electric
power by harnessing the energy of photons from sunlight. However, the efficiency
of solar panels is greatly influenced by the angle and orientation of the panels
relative to the sun.
Sunlight tracking systems aim to optimize the orientation of solar panels by
continuously adjusting their position to face the sun directly. This dynamic
approach enhances energy capture throughout the day, maximizing overall
efficiency. Sunlight tracking is particularly beneficial in regions with variable
sunlight conditions or during seasons with changing sun angles.# Solar-based-project--Sunlight-Tracking-Solar-Panel
